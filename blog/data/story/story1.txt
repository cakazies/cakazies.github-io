    <p>A smile can last a lifetime-if you take care of it. For that reason, it’s
        important for parents to instill good oral health habits in children as early as
        possible.</p>
    <p>According to U.S. Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona’s “National Call to Action
        to Promote Oral Health” report, children lose more than 51 million school hours
        and adults lose more than 164 million work hours each year
        due to dental disease or dental visits. The nation’s total bill for dental
        services was estimated to be more than $70.1 billion in 2002.</p>
